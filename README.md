## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Applications:
 Sweatcoin: 
 - Cool immersive background, that moves as you move. 
 - the virtuak currency 
 Duolingo:
 - the ability to choose multiple languages 
 - able to claim rewards
 - getting to know other people
 Fetch:
 - Scan receipts from emails and online stores 
 - gives products that make you earn more points 
 
My app brainstorm:
    My app would be a running app that has an immersive narrative experience to
    your workout routine. As you run, a story would unfold a very soothing story
    that motivates you to keep running and achieve your goals. The narrative would
    evolve based on your progress, providing personalized motivation throughout
    your run. Along your running routine, there would be virtual checkpoints where
    you could collect special tokens with the story. These checkpoints could be
    represented by trees, as you reach each checkpoint you'll contribute to a
    virtual forest, which grows as you run more and plant more trees. Once you
    accumulate enough trees, youll be able to turn them into currency that can be
    used to sponsor the planting of real trees. The app would also track your
    running distance, pace, and achievements.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    Had trouble with the code, previously i added the function changeColor inside the @IBAction func changeBackgroundColor. Which did not change the color of the background so after debugging i was able to understand that the function  changeColor should be seperate from the @IBAction func changeBackgroundColor.
